# Arduino_Timer <br/>

This is a university assignment, I figured it was a suitable piece of my work that highlghts my interest in low-level and embedded software programming <br/>
The aim of the project was to create a functional timer on a ATMEL328 microcontroller. <br/> <br/>

Functionality: <br/> 
- Written in C 
- Input time in seconds 
- The amount of time inputted can be changed between 1 - 5 using a potentiometer 
- Can be restarted to be used again 
- Uses LEDs to indicate the current state of the timer <br/>

Improvements <br/>
- Improve the responsiveness of the interrupts <br/>
- Add a sound to alert the user when the time has finished <br/> <br/>

<br/> Thanks for checking this out!
